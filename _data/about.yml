              Thanks to the provided collaboration platform and community, multiple authors may work altogether on a single book. With the help of blockchain technology that tracks every single change from all authors, we can calculate and distribute the final revenue for each and every one of them in a trustless environment. Moreover, all changes are voted based on the on-chain reputation system to avoid fraud and manipulations from any bad potential participants.

  description: Crowd publishing takes what’s the best from both current models of publishing
               <ul>
                <li>traditional publishing - giving support during the process of book writing, providing the whole framework of making a book from the very first idea till the book publication, having editors, translators and marketing platform. Moreover, the fact of using crowd publishing may be a marketing driver by itself.</li>
                <li>self-publishing - giving much better royalties and control over your book while not overwhelming you with the amount of lonely work.</li>

                 <li><b>huge time-effort</b> - Working together with dozens of authors, where every chapter is a product of multiple contributions and suggestions makes it much more doable. Simply put, it is much easier to find a time for writing 20 pages of content, than 200 pages of content!</li>
                 <li><b>small financial revenue</b> - No more 10% royalties. Crowd publishing connects high royalties with the support of the community and collaborative work on the book</li>
                 <li><b>niche topics</b> - if you’ll find enough co-authors you can work together on whatever you believe will be read</li>

                 <li><b>outdated books</b> - in crowd publishing there is a financial incentive to constantly update already published books. Both from multiple co-authors and from readers themselve</li>
                 <li><b>no resell</b> - thanks to Crowdpub you can resell an e-book after reading it. And with a crowd publishing platform it gives you a way to earn from fixes and suggestions</li>
                 <li><b>bad editing, typos and errors</b> - crowd publishing backed by an on-chain platform allows a structured, automated, voted and accountable feedback loop</li>
